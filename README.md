# Shader-Programming
CSC418 Assignment 2 on Shaders and shader implementations

## Goal 

The goal of this project was to solidify my understanding of shader algorithms. Over the course of this assignment I implemented 
various styles of shaders.

# Usage 
Have python installed on your local machine.

Start a SimpleHTTPServer in the root of the repo.
```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Then navigate to ![localhost:8000](localhost:8000)
